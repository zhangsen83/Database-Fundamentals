# 🍽️ Restaurant Database System

## 📖 Overview
This project is a database system for managing a restaurant’s operations, including customers, menu items, orders, and staff.

## 🍽️ Sunway Food Hub Database Project
- This is a database fundamentals group project for simulating the operations of a modern food court.  
- The system manages customers, orders, menu items, combo meals, customizations, staff, and transactions.

## 👨‍💻 My Contribution
I was responsible for developing the following sections:
- **SQL Script (sunway_food_hub.sql)**: Created tables, inserted sample data, and wrote queries for orders, customizations, and reports.
- **Queries Implementation**: Developed scenario-based queries such as frequently ordered items, customer filtering, and total orders per food station.
- **Data Population**: Inserted realistic sample data for customers, menu items, orders, combo meals, customizations, staff, and transactions.

🧰 Technologies Used
- Oracle SQL
- SQL Scripts
- Data Modeling (ERD/Crow’s Foot Notation)


📜 Project Summary
This project demonstrates fundamental database development skills including:
- Designing relational databases using proper normalization (up to 4NF)
- Creating tables with primary and foreign keys
- Populating tables with realistic sample data
- Writing queries for reporting, filtering, and scenario-based analysis
- Implementing business rules and constraints (e.g., combo meal rules, stock availability, payment validation)
- Documenting the system scenario, ERD, and business rules

🏁 Outcome
Through this project, I strengthened my knowledge of:
- **Database Design** – creating normalized relational schemas with entities, relationships, and constraints
- **SQL Implementation** – writing DDL, DML, and complex queries to retrieve and analyze data
- **Data Integrity & Validation** – enforcing rules for stock, customizations, and payments
- **Project Documentation** – producing clear ERDs, business rules, and scenario descriptions
- **Team Collaboration** – coordinating with teammates effectively and managing shared code using GitHub version control
